# Clutch Under Pressure: NFL Team Performance in High-Leverage Situations
This project analyzes how NFL teams perform during the highest-pressure moments of a game, known as clutch situations. Clutch plays are defined as offensive snaps occurring in the 4th quarter, within the final five minutes, and when the score margin is eight points or fewer. Using multiple seasons of NFL play-by-play data from the nflverse project, this analysis evaluates team performance using advanced metrics such as Expected Points Added (EPA) and Win Probability Added (WPA). The goal is to understand which teams rise under pressure, how clutch performance compares to overall offensive efficiency, and how machine learning can be used to predict clutch strength. The entire workflow is implemented in Python using Visual Studio Code with Jupyter Notebook.
## Features
- Multi-season NFL dataset (2019, 2020, 2021, 2023)
- Automatic clutch play identification
- Team-level clutch metrics: EPA, WPA, success rate, clutch improvement score
- Clean exploratory analysis with inline visualizations
- Machine learning prediction of clutch EPA using Random Forests
- JSON export of team-season clutch results
- Fully reproducible and organized analysis pipeline
## Clutch Definition
A play is considered clutch if it occurs in the 4th quarter, there are 300 seconds or fewer remaining, and the score differential is 8 points or fewer. These conditions reflect true high-leverage situations where game outcomes can shift dramatically and align with standards commonly used in football analytics.
## Technologies Used
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- scikit-learn
- Visual Studio Code with Jupyter Notebook
